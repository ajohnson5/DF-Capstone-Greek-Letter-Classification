Note this is instructional and the programming portion should be done in the \"Classifying_Handwritten_Greek_Letters\" workbook so feel free to copy and paste the code that will follow into the \"My Images\" section. Some of the code in this workbook relies on functions from the other workbook and some of the imported packages. "

        "\n",
        "To actually create the images you can use any drawing tool online or one you own. I would personally recommend https://kleki.com/  for a few reasons. There are a couple of key facts we must remember about the images in the HASYv2 dataset:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   Images are 32x32 in size\n",
        "2.   Images are black and white\n",
        "3. Letters are not drawn with a pixelatted pencil effect rather than a smooth brush. \n",
        "\n",
        "Kleki allows us to complete all of these objectives easily. To reshape the image size we begin by clicking the \"Edit\" tab on the right hand size and then clicking \"Resize\" button that appears. This allows us to specify a width and height of 32 pixels (if you struggle to do this remember to turn off \"Constrain Proportions\"). Next we use the pixel drawing option which is one of the options for your cursor just above the size slider. The size slider should be set 1 as since our images are very small, any bigger and you wont fit the letter in their. With all of these steps completed you are now ready to begin writing whether that be with your mouse or if you want, and own one, use your graphics tablet to more accuractely represent your handwriting. I would recommend going in the order of the image above, starting from alpha and continuing as if you were reading a book. After each letter has been written, Kleki easily allows you to download the image with the blue downwards arrow in the top right. \n",
